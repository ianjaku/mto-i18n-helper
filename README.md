# Manual.to translate

A simple extension to make adding translations much easier.
It only has a single command "Manual.to translate" which:

1. Asks for a translation key (ex: Edit_PublishButton)
2. Asks for a version of every translation (making suggestions using Deepl)
3. Adds the correct lines in the language files
4. Maybe replaces the selection in the editor with t(TK.Edit_PublishButton)

## Installation

```
code --install-extension mto-lang-x.x.x.vsix
```
